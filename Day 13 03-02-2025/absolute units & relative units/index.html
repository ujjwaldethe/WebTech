          - cm (centimeters): Represents a physical measurement in centimeters.
          - mm (millimeters): Represents a physical measurement in millimeters.
          - in (inches): Represents a physical measurement in inches.
          - pc (picas): Represents 1/6th of an inch.
          - pt (points): Represents 1/72nd of an inch.
