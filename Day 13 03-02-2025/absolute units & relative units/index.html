        This file demonstrates the use of absolute units in CSS for styling web elements. 
        Absolute units are fixed and are not relative to other elements or the viewport. 
        Common absolute units include:
          - px (pixels): Represents a single dot on the screen.
          - cm (centimeters): Represents a physical measurement in centimeters.
          - mm (millimeters): Represents a physical measurement in millimeters.
          - in (inches): Represents a physical measurement in inches.
          - pc (picas): Represents 1/6th of an inch.
          - pt (points): Represents 1/72nd of an inch.
        These units are useful for precise, fixed layouts but may not be ideal for responsive designs.

    <!-- Relative Units
         em (element): Relative to the font-size of the element's parent.
         rem (root element): Relative to the font-size of the root element.
         vw (viewport width): Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport.
         vh (viewport height): Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.
         vmin (viewport minimum): Relative to 1% of the smaller dimension of the viewport.
         vmax (viewport maximum): Relative to 1% of the larger dimension of the viewport.
         % (percentage): Relative to the size of the parent element.
